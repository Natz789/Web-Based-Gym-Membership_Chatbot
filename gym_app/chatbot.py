WORKOUT TIPS:
- Warm up 5-10 minutes before exercise
- Progressive overload: gradually increase weight/reps
- Rest 48 hours between training same muscle groups
- Mix cardio and strength training
- Stay hydrated (drink water before, during, after)

BEGINNER ROUTINE (3 days/week):
- Day 1: Upper body (push-ups, rows, shoulder press)
- Day 2: Lower body (squats, lunges, leg press)
- Day 3: Full body circuit with cardio

NUTRITION BASICS:
- Protein: 1.6-2.2g per kg body weight for muscle building
- Eat whole foods, avoid processed foods
- Pre-workout: carbs + protein 1-2 hours before
- Post-workout: protein within 30-60 minutes
- Stay hydrated: 2-3 liters water daily

GYM ETIQUETTE:
- Wipe down equipment after use
- Re-rack weights properly
- Share equipment, don't hog machines
- Use headphones for music
- Respect personal space

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Skipping warm-up and cool-down
- Poor form (risking injury)
- Not tracking progress
- Inconsistent training
- Overtraining without rest
